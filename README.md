Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

Open - Closed Principle

Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

Interface Segregation Principle

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle

Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
